PAN4ELEC ROCKINPROJEX VERSION. INDEV AND UNOFICCIAL. USE AT OWN RISK.
--- 

An **unofficial** remake of AmberELEC for R36S devices that are V5/Panel 4. Also an **unofficial** mod to Pan4Elec.

*A clone of a clone OS for a clone of a clone SBC. How ironic!*


Including a whole new look for PAN4ELEC! This fan-made image has only given me joy. Huge up to **Kegg1701** for making the original image.


This version is based entirely off of the original, with a few extra updates:
- More customisation (MOAR colours! Finally, you can have a single colour unifying your OS!)
- Extra themes - all developed either by myself or by AmberELEC, Pan4Elec or EmulationStation.
- SO MUCH MORE! Seriously, I develop this OS with a single goal in mind - total FUN!


## Installation
---

Grab an SD card of any size. Kegg1701 recommended 16GB, but I use 64GB for my personal Pan4Elec SD and 128GB for my dev card running this.

Format it as ext4 if you're on Linux. Elsewhere ExFAT is your best bet as ext4 doesn't play nicely with Windows and Mac.

Download the latest image over at the Releases tab.

Follow the next sections to complete:


Windows
---

Download any disk writer you want. From BalenaEtcher to Rufus, pretty much anything will work.

Flash that SD!

Put it into the R36S. Verify it works.

You're all set!

Completing
---

If you wish to use a dual TF setup, check the compatability guide to verify your card will work and then:
  Format it as ext4/ExFAT (again, OS dependent).
  Turn off the R36S.
  Insert the card in the correct slot. It should be marked as "TF2 Game".
    Should it not, report it to r/R36S and show them where you bought it - it may be an elaborate clone.
  Turn on the R36S. It should tell you it's formatting the card.
  
  
Once ready, grab some ROMs. Legally I can NOT tell you where to get them. Don't open PRs, Issues, etc to try to get me to add sources.


Have a good time with the build. I hope to eventually see some of my stuff in Pan4Elec but it seems unlikely.


Be sure to check out Kegg1701's GitHub for the original image, instructions, etc. and give them a star while you're at it! This would not have been possible without their work.


*Oh welp. Here we go! Yet another abandoned and forgotten project! Yippee! I can't wait!*
